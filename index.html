        <div class="subheading mb-5">Speech and Language Pathologist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a speech and language pathologist, or SLP, I work with individuals of all ages, treating various types of communication and swallowing problems. When working in speech and therapy, I encounter many different research, education, and health care settings with varying roles, levels of responsibility, and client populations.<br><br>

        Throughout a number of experiences, I have aided in speech sounds, language, social communication, voice, fluency, and feeding and swallowing. In other words, I have helped individuals improve their speech, comprehend others and express themselves, communicate more effectively in social settings, swallow safely, and open up new communication possibilities if they encounter limited or no speaking ability. Having the capacity to communicate and comprehend through speech and language is something that every individual should be able to freely express. As a speech and language pathologist, I am able to implement a number of strategies, including language intervention activities, articulation theory, and oral-motor/feeding and swallowing therapy. Why do some children require speech-language therapy? Kids might need speech-language therapy for numerous reasons, including hearing impairments, cognitive or other developmental delays, weak oral muscles, chronic hoarseness, cleft lip or cleft palate, autism, motor planning problems, articulation problems, fluency disorders, respiratory problems, feeding and swallowing disorders, and/or traumatic brain injury.<br><br>

        I have always been intrigued by the work executed by speech and language pathologists ever since I was in high school, and have felt excited to work with and help individuals of many different ages. As for why I wanted to become an SLP, I wanted to impact lives. I wanted to help others communicate and advocate for their wants and needs, as well as make a difference on an individual's daily needs. My brain loves the sciences, and so I was satisfied with knowing that I would be able to use this skill set in order to help others. I have had wonderful and eye-opening opportunities throughout my career, whether it be conducting research on resonance disorders or working in hospitals to serve patients in speech and language. During my personal time, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and gardening. I also cherish time spent with family and friends, especially when catching up or taking road trips. Working as a speech and language therapist has not only helped me to gain confidence in my leadership skills, but has also helped me to realize that I am capable of aiding others and their needs through my education, learning experiences, and various encounters with a number of patients. Although I have gained an abundance of knowledge while working in such a field, I am always on the lookout to experience and achieve new findings, studies, and overall knowledge in order to better my work. Most importantly, I hope to continue to help individuals of all ages with their communication by effectively assisting with the improvement of their verbal and non-verbal language skills, as well as helping them with their feeding and swallowing abilities. Working as an SLP has been such a gratifying experience, and I only aim to continue on with my practice.
